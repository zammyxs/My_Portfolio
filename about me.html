            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am Zalme P. Tagailo, 18 years of age, born on February 18, 2004 - an Aquarius. 
            Born in Lapu-Lapu City, Cebu, I currently live in Sevilla, Bohol.</p>
            
            <p>I'm neither an introvert nor an extrovert, but somewhere in between. 
            I like cats more than people. Music is my therapy when everything feels draining. 
            I let things be for their own sanity.</p>

            <h2>My Life Philosophy</h2>
            <p>My guiding principle in life is to enjoy each moment while staying true to myself. 
            Living with integrity is important, and it's easier when you have guiding principles 
            to reflect on your actions and choices.</p>
            
            <p>I'm not so different from others - I make mistakes like everyone else, 
            but I learn from them and grow.</p>

            <h2>My Accomplishments</h2>
            <p>At my age, I don't have many major accomplishments yet, but becoming independent 
            at a young age is one of them. Simply being able to wake up each day and face new 
            challenges is an achievement in itself.</p>
            
            <p>I don't know if I've already made my parents proud. They say they are, 
            but for me, it's not enough yet. I want to accomplish more to make them even prouder.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h2>My Future Plans</h2>
            <p>My goal is to make my parents proud and become successful so I can give back 
            everything they've given me.</p>
            
            <p class="highlight">"Sometimes we're so focused on the future that we don't realize 
            today was what we were praying for yesterday."</p>
